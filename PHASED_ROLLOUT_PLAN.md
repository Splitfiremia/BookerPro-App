## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Phase 1 Risks
- **Complex State Management**: Use established patterns with `@nkzw/create-context-hook` and React Query
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Implement Platform-specific checks for web limitations
- **Performance Issues**: Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback for optimization

### Phase 2 Risks
- **API Integration Failures**: Implement comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Data Synchronization Issues**: Use React Query's built-in retry and background sync
- **Network Connectivity**: Implement robust offline mode with local caching

### Phase 3 Risks
- **Payment Processing Failures**: Implement comprehensive Stripe error handling and retry logic
- **Data Consistency**: Use optimistic updates with rollback mechanisms
- **Concurrent Booking Conflicts**: Implement proper locking mechanisms in reservation system

### Phase 4 Risks
- **Beta User Feedback Overload**: Prioritize feedback using impact/effort matrix
- **Performance Under Load**: Implement gradual user onboarding and monitoring
- **Feature Scope Creep**: Maintain strict feature freeze during beta testing

### Phase 5 Risks
- **Scaling Issues**: Implement auto-scaling and load testing before launch
- **Support Overwhelm**: Have comprehensive self-service options and escalation procedures
- **Market Competition**: Focus on unique value propositions and user experience
