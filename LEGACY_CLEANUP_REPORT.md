# Legacy Pages Cleanup Report

## Overview
Completed audit and cleanup of legacy/orphaned pages to reduce bundle size and improve code maintainability.

## Pages Audited
The following 18 legacy pages were audited for active references:

### Pages with Active References (KEPT)
These pages are still referenced in the codebase and were kept:

1. **app/provider/[id].tsx** - Referenced in navigation layouts
2. **app/booking.tsx** - Referenced in appointment-details.tsx
3. **app/appointment-details.tsx** - Referenced in booking.tsx and provider schedule
4. **app/provider-calendar.tsx** - Referenced in provider schedule and profile
5. **app/tip-settings.tsx** - Referenced in provider profile
6. **app/earnings-dashboard.tsx** - Referenced in advanced-analytics.tsx
7. **app/payout-settings.tsx** - Referenced in provider profile and shop-owner settings
8. **app/advanced-analytics.tsx** - Referenced in earnings-dashboard and shop-owner-dashboard
9. **app/shop-owner-dashboard.tsx** - Referenced in shop-owner onboarding
10. **app/multi-shop-calendar.tsx** - Referenced in shop-owner-dashboard
11. **app/multi-shop-team.tsx** - Referenced in shop-owner-dashboard
12. **app/booth-rent-dashboard.tsx** - Referenced in shop-owner-dashboard
13. **app/reset-onboarding.tsx** - Referenced in onboarding-status
14. **app/onboarding-status.tsx** - Referenced in app/_layout.tsx and index.tsx
15. **app/unstuck.tsx** - Referenced in app/_layout.tsx
16. **app/book.tsx** - Referenced in booking service utilities

### Pages Deleted (REMOVED)
These pages had zero references and were safely deleted:

1. **app/shop-settings/[id].tsx** - No references found
2. **app/team-performance.tsx** - No references found

### Pages with Booking System Integration (KEPT)
Several pages are part of the active booking system:
- **app/booking/service-selection.tsx** - Active booking flow
- **app/booking/calendar-selection.tsx** - Active booking flow  
- **app/booking/time-selection.tsx** - Active booking flow

## Impact Assessment

### Bundle Size Reduction
- **2 pages removed** from the bundle
- Estimated reduction: ~5-10KB (minified)
- Reduced complexity in routing and navigation

### Code Maintainability
- Eliminated dead code paths
- Reduced cognitive load for developers
- Cleaner file structure

### Functionality Impact
- **No functionality lost** - all deleted pages were orphaned
- **No navigation broken** - all active references preserved
- **Booking system intact** - all booking flows maintained

## Recommendations

### Future Cleanup Opportunities
1. **Legacy booking pages** (app/booking.tsx, app/appointment-details.tsx) could potentially be migrated to the main app structure
2. **Provider-specific pages** (app/provider/[id].tsx, app/provider-calendar.tsx) could be consolidated with main provider dashboard
3. **Analytics pages** could be further integrated into main dashboard views

### Monitoring
- Monitor for any broken navigation after deployment
- Track bundle size metrics to confirm reduction
- Watch for any missing functionality reports

## Files Modified
- **Deleted**: app/shop-settings/[id].tsx
- **Deleted**: app/team-performance.tsx
- **No references updated** (pages were truly orphaned)

## Conclusion
Successfully cleaned up 2 orphaned legacy pages without breaking any existing functionality. The remaining 16 pages are actively used and should be kept until their functionality is migrated to the main app structure.

**Status**: âœ… Cleanup Complete
**Bundle Impact**: Reduced
**Functionality Impact**: None
**Risk Level**: Low
